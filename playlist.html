  <h2 class="talk-name">What Y’all Need to Know About Captioned Videos on Social Media, Eh?</h2>
  <div class="talk-desc">
    <p>What you do for Twitter won’t be the same as Instagram or Facebook. LinkedIn and Facebook both allow you to upload a caption file, but Facebook has one difference you need to know about. Some social media platforms allow you to do closed captions while others require open captions or using their built-in captioning tool. Meryl will explore how to ensure your videos have captions on social media and the best practices. After all, adding captions is only half the battle. The other half is quality. Many videos flub on the quality of the captions and lose out on the advantages captions have to offer. Don’t let yours be one of them by applying Meryl’s Caption 10 rules for great captions.</p>

  <h2 class="talk-name">Conducting Inclusive and accessible User Interviews</h2>
  <div class="talk-desc">
    <p>As a product developer, making inclusive and user-centered products should be the core of our design thinking process. To achieve this designers should have a focused and diverse community of research participants and should take note of ethnicity, gender, race, and even disabilities. To design user-centered products, designers should interview diverse users, taking into consideration qualitative and quantitative research methods. In this talk, I'll be highlighting ways designers can gather more resourceful insights through interviews by making the process inclusive and accessible to participants. How to conduct these interviews and translate research results.</p>

      <p>Hi, I'm victory from Nigeria. I am a user experience designer passionate about accessible designs and crafting simple user experiences with the users in mind. I believe that a diverse environment can inspire innovation that can solve user problems. The drive for the Inclusion of marginalized users led to my thirst for design advocacy roles. I have over 1-year of experience in User Experience Design, after trying out HTML and CSS which I'm vaguely familiar with. My interests surround working with and advocating assistive and adaptive technologies that improve learning, and other product development that is User-centered. I value collaborative communities, even as a self-starter, I understand and encourage teamwork. It creates an environment for multiple and diverse ideas which helps Innovation. (I highly recommend it if you're trying to be user-centered). I love to learn new trends and approaches to User-centered design.</p>
