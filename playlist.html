  <h2 id="Culture-eats-Technology" class="talk-title">Culture eats Technology for Breakfast</h2>
  <div class="talk-desc">
    <p>When it comes to digital accessibility, many organizations often turn to tools and audits first. This is increasingly moving from automated testing tools to mystical AI tools. Audits and tools play a crucial role in a comprehensive accessibility strategy. But without the right organizational culture behind them, they often fall short. </p>
    <p>Why? Because, as management expert Peter Drucker famously said, “Culture eats strategy for breakfast.” In the accessibility world, we might adapt that to say: “Culture eats technology for breakfast.”</p>
    <p>No matter how powerful your tools or how advanced your platforms, true digital inclusion doesn't scale without a supportive culture. If we want accessibility to stick, we need culture change: authentic buy-in, leadership commitment, accountability, positive encouragement and space to make mistakes and learn. Let's discuss what this should look like.</p>

  <h2 id="Behind-the-Insights" class="talk-title">Behind the Insights: How we keep missing disability in UX Research and what to do about it</h2>
  <div class="talk-desc">
    <p>As accessibility efforts mature within a team, someone eventually asks, “Can we include disabled people in our research?” The answer should be an easy yes — but in practice, it often doesn’t happen.</p>
    <p>This talk will explore the everyday barriers that prevent researchers from including disabled participants, from recruitment hurdles to inaccessible tools. But it will also go deeper to confront the ableist work practices that keep disabled people out of research roles altogether. We’ll get honest about how well-meaning teams contribute to a cycle of exclusion, even when inclusion is the stated goal.</p>

    <p>In this bold and personal talk, Pooja Joshi—a writer, producer, stand-up comic, and equity leader at CBC—unpacks how storytelling can be a tool for structural change. Drawing from a career that spans continents, genres, and uncomfortable conversations, she shares lessons from five years of running a mentorship program for racialized women, serving on a national equity committee, and creating digital platforms that center belonging over hierarchy.</p>
    <p>With humour, heart, and hard-won insight, Pooja invites us to reimagine inclusion not as a checkbox—but as a creative, courageous act of design.</p>

  <div class="talk-desc">
    <p>Users can choose from various ways to view your content, including fonts, text size, dark mode, reader mode, custom stylesheets, and more. By leaning into these user customizations instead of resisting them, we can design in a more resilient way that meets users where they are.</p>
    <p>We'll explore some common ways users customize their devices and examine techniques for anticipating and embracing those changes. Some specific examples will include Windows High Contrast Mode (aka forced-colors in CSS), changing the device font size, and user stylesheets.</p>

  <div class="talk-desc">
    <p>We often assume that users behave rationally, believing they read instructions, follow a linear path, and complete tasks without error. But real interactions are far messier. People misclick, get distracted, skip instructions, or abandon tasks. For users with cognitive disabilities, ADHD, trauma histories, or anxiety, these behaviours are not edge cases. They are daily realities.</p>
    <p>Ina will demonstrate how accessibility testing can address these challenges through practical strategies based on cognitive accessibility principles, behavioural science, trauma-informed design, and emotional accessibility, making systems more forgiving, predictable, and inclusive.</p>

  <div class="talk-desc">
    <p>Design is more than what users see: beyond fonts, colours, and legibility. It’s also about how we engage with people throughout the process. As designers and researchers, we gather stories and insights to center real experiences in the systems we build. But whether you work in healthcare, justice, housing, or accessibility fields, many of the people we interview and co-design with carry a history of adversity, marginalization, or trauma.</p>
    <p>What if the way we conduct research unintentionally harms the very people we aim to support? How do we create emotional and psychological safety during interviews, testing, and co-design sessions?</p>
    <p>This talk is especially relevant to Service Designers, UX Researchers, Civic Innovators, and Accessibility professionals working in complex or equity-driven spaces. You’ll leave with strategies to make your design work relationally safe and ethically grounded.</p>

  <div class="talk-desc">
    <p>AI coding tools like GitHub Copilot, Cursor, and Claude Code are revolutionizing development by letting anyone build interfaces with simple prompts. But here's the problem: they're trained on decades of inaccessible code, perpetuating the same barriers we're fighting to eliminate. When you ask these tools to generate a web application, they can generate beautiful, but frequently inaccessible interfaces.</p>
    <p>This talk reveals how to become an "accessibility prompt engineer"—teaching developers specific techniques to guide AI tools toward WCAG-compliant outputs. Through live demonstrations and real-world examples, you'll learn proven prompting strategies that consistently produce semantic HTML, proper ARIA implementation, and inclusive interaction patterns. We'll explore how to validate AI-generated code for accessibility compliance and build team prompt libraries that make inclusive development the default, not an afterthought.</p>

      <p>Mike Mai is an expert in design systems, web accessibility, HTML/CSS, and typography. His design philosophy is rooted in a fundamental understanding of the web. Mike's passion for typography, cultivated during my BFA in Graphic Design at Massachusetts College of Art and Design, directly informed my decision to pursue web design professionally. He considers typography to be the most critical foundation of any website, given its text-centric nature, making typeface selection and typesetting my first order of business on any new projects.</p>
      <p>Mike firmly believes that design is about solving problems, a principle instilled by a formative mentor. This conviction drove his path to specializing in accessible web design. While strong typographic forms are important, they must be balanced with robust function and an intuitive user experience. He is committed to ensuring all his designs are usable, useful, and truly inclusive.</p>

  <h2 id="It-is-designed-to-break-your-heart" class="talk-title">It is designed to break your heart: Cultivating a harm reduction mindset as an accessibility practitioner</h2>
  <div class="talk-desc">
    <p>Working in digital accessibility requires so much. From design, to code, to theory, to practice. There’s also minding arcane, technical details, all the way up to the holistic big picture. Then factor in concerns like history, politics, law, and armchair psychology.</p>
    <p>For many of us, it is also deeply personal work, felt far deeper than the day-to-day requirements of a regular job. The constant demand for perfection, coupled with the asymmetry of power that accessibility work compels, is a recipe for harm if boundaries and protections are not established.</p>
    <p>This talk references the practice of harm reduction as a methodology to help you sustain your best efforts and avoid burnout.</p>
