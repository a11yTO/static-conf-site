  <h2 class="talk-name">Stem to Stern Accessibility</h2>
  <div class="talk-desc">
    <p>This workshop is a general overview workshop aimed at everyone involved in IT from executives to PMs, designers, developers, and QA. There is no code in this workshop. At the end of this workshop, you'll know all of the various places to consider accessibility and the best practices for doing so.</p>
    <p>Depending on the audience, Accessibility is often treated as either a coding discussion or a compliance discussion, without considering the relationship between the two. Worse, it is almost never discussed as part of the larger discussion of quality. This results in projects that are inaccessible, expensive, and late.</p>
    <p>The path to an inclusively-designed and compliant product is paved through the integration of accessibility at all phases of the development lifecycle.</p>
    <p>Accessibility must begin and continue through management commitment, vision, and planning, through design and coding, to testing, documentation and delivery. In this workshop, we will explore ways for integrating accessibility into software development. Whether you work in a large or small organization, follow an agile or waterfall process, are experienced or just starting out, this workshop will guide you toward reliably developing accessible and usable products. Integrating accessibility relies on a diverse set of skills across the product-development spectrum, so this workshop is structured to be inclusive and engaging to all skill sets and levels. Your participation will be encouraged through group interaction and shared experiences as we explore the process of building not only an accessible software product, but a culture that sustains cost-effective, ongoing delivery of accessible products.</p>
    <p>Learning Objectives:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Understand accessibility's place in project management</li>
      <li>Learn about procuring ICT to ensure accessibility</li>
      <li>Learn about accessible design and development concepts</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Wednesday, October 18 - Morning and in Person. <a href="https://tickets.a11yto.com/e/9" rel="external">Grab your tickets before October 1st</a>!</p>
