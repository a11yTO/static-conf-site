  <h2 id="workshop-1" class="talk-name">Putting inclusion in design</h2>
  <div class="talk-desc">
    <p>In this workshop, Henny will discuss how people with disabilities experience the web and how you can meet those needs within your designs. You'll have a chance to try out tools that you can integrate into your design process as well as put your knowledge into practice by annotating some designs for accessibility using our TetraLogical’s accessible design toolkit.</p>

      <p>Henny Swan, a Director at TetraLogical, has been working in accessibility since 2001. </p>
      <p>In that time she’s worked on inclusive media players for BBC and Netflix, helped implement an accessibility framework and guidelines at BBC, co-authored the <a href="https://inclusivedesignprinciples.org/" rel="external nofollow">Inclusive Design Principles</a>, contributed to various Web Accessibility Initiative working groups, and spoken at a variety of conferences around the world. </p>
      <p>In between all that, she can be found wild swimming in her native Brighton in the UK and trying to convince her 13-year-old to put a coat on.</p>
