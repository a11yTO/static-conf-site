  <h2 class="talk-name">The Double-Edged Sword of A11y: How Both Academia and Industry Get Accessibility Wrong</h2>
  <div class="talk-desc">
    <p>Academic institutions and private companies are both major contributors to our technology landscape, with a primarily theoretical and future-looking focus in academia and consumer product focus in industry. </p>
    <p>However, what is often not scrutinized is how accessibility (a11y) and disability are viewed by members within each institution, particularly non-disabled members. </p>
    <p>These viewpoints have a significant impact on the outcomes of inclusion. For example, many academic research papers focus on projects that are “for” disabled people, many consumer products in industry are inaccessible and create barriers, and rarely do either groups properly acknowledge the existence, autonomy, and inventiveness of disabled people leading to outcomes like “disability dongles”. </p>
    <p>This presentation will reflect on the various forms of ableism currently prevalent in both academia and industry in hopes of spurring more mindfulness of true inclusion.</p>

  <h2 class="talk-name">Selling Accessibility</h2>
  <div class="talk-desc">
    <p>For many internal accessibility staff, or for persons who consider themselves accessibility advocates, it might feel hard to get other people to care about accessibility. It is such a common source of frustration that it tends to become an underlying theme during social conversations and Q&A times during accessibility conferences. Many people tend to gravitate towards attempting to sell accessibility via the “Business Case” using spurious logic and conjecture. During this presentation I’ll show that the “Business Case” isn’t what puts signatures to paper and allocates resources to accessibility. There’s a much easier way that just takes a little practice.</p>

  <h2 class="talk-name">These (still) aren't the SCs you're looking for...</h2>
  <div class="talk-desc">
    <p>WCAG is supposed to give us a reasonably objective way of saying whether or not the sites we are building/auditing are "accessible" (to a particular baseline). However, they are only as useful as our understanding and interpretation of the guidelines' normative text. And, of course, it is not perfect - with some omissions, handwaving, and straight-up loopholes. So where does this leave developers and auditors? </p>

  <div class="talk-desc">
    <p>After all the WCAG standards are met, how accessible is your site for users with cognitive disabilities? </p>
    <p>How can you tell? What does that mean? Where would you even start?</p>
    <p>I’d been making websites for over 20 years, and I didn’t understand what it was like to use the web with a cognitive disability until I developed one. After treatment to remove a slow-growing brain tumor, I had a hard time using most websites, including the ones I built! This real-world experience gave me a newfound perspective on accessibility, and I learned that there’s no better way to understand a user’s experience than living it. It also motivated me to learn new techniques that provide more accessible experiences for users with cognitive impairments and redesign parts of my sites with a focus on cognitive ease.</p>

    <p>As the old saying goes, a fish rots from the head down. Which means if your design system doesn’t include clear and meaningful commitments to accessibility, your products and services are going to stink.</p>
    <p>Based on a careful look at the language and value statements in over 100 public design systems, I’ve developed an accessibility assessment framework. In this talk I’ll explain how to clearly communicate your company’s stance on accessibility and avoid dead fish. I’ll also discuss how to structure your design system so accessibility guidance is easy to find and use.</p>

  <div class="talk-desc">
    <p>Fixing Accessibility Issues is a tedious and expensive task that nobody enjoys doing. </p>
    <p>Preventing the most common issues can save a lot of money and free up engineers to focus on exciting feature work instead. </p>
    <p>Ensuring UX is well educated and able to define, document and communicate Accessibility functionality early on is the key to a successful shift to building accessible Experiences.

    <p> Accessibility is often perceived as a complex or costly step.
