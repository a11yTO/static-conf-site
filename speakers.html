            <p class="speaker-bio">Cherry Thompson is an accessibility consultant with a professional background in photography, film and visual art. After a 12 year career in these fields, disability led them to shift focus and adapt to a new career. They bring their experience in design, production and exploring marginalized identities with visual storytelling to the games industry. Cherry's disabilities have allowed them to specialize in accessibility in games with a particular focus on addressing complex motor and cognitive barriers. They've consulted on projects of various sizes from small indie developments to larger studios such as Xbox (Adaptive Controller), Guerrilla (Horizon Zero Dawn IP), The Coalition (Gears of War IP) and more. Their consulting experience includes education, work-shopping, design consultation, sensitivity reviews, accessibility audits and play testing. In addition, Cherry has delivered educational presentations in various studios and at GDC, Microsoft Bootcamp, EA and their favorite, the Games Accessibility Conference. They have a passion for making games inclusive for everyone regardless of their background or disabilities. Outside of games Cherry is a bird, nature and cake enthusiast and has a one eyed cat named Odin.</p>
