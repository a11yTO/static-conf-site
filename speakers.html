          <h3>Rethinking web accessibility on Windows</h3>
          <p>For more than 15 years, screen readers on Windows have consumed web sites in much the same manner: Consuming them in one go and providing their own representation of the web page in a so-called virtual document. As web applications have become more pwide-spread, it has become apparent that this way of consuming web content might no longer be timely. This talk aims to take a look at the status quo and ask some provocative questions on how this paradigm might, or must, change in the future for us to stay competitive and up to date in the more dynamic web application world.</p>

          <h3>Accessibility: No rights without responsibilities</h3>
          <p>People with disabilities have a right to web accessibility. But what of their responsibility? Both developers and web users with disabilities must work together. Users have a responsibility to talk to developers, who have a responsibility to listen and implement. This talk takes a look at some specific actions everyone can take to push accessibility forward.</p>
