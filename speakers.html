    <p>I am the Practice Manager for Training at TPGi, so spend my days training our clients on how to make their websites and digital products accessible. I have a background in front-end development and development management, having worked in digital agencies in Toronto for 15 years before joining TPGi.
      I am also the TPGi Advisory Committee representative for the W3C and currently co-chair the Accessibility Education and Outreach Working Group.</p>
      <p>I live in Toronto with my wife and twin 12-year-old girls, and when I am not trying to make the digital world more accessible, I can be found working on my house, exercising, or relaxing with a crossword puzzle.</p>
