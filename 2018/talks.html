          <h2 class="talkName">Sustaining Accessibility – an Enterprise Commitment</h2>
          <p class="talkDesc">Most of us know how to make our products accessible. More crucial than that is the question: how do we keep them that way? Some risks that might lead to slipping back in our accessibility status are: critical employee turnover, technology transitions, inaccessible white label components, inadequate processes and inefficient policies. An enterprise-level accessibility program can effectively manage these risks and more. In this talk, I will share some struggles and success stories around accessibility management.</p>

          <h2 class="talkName">Finding the Place Where Accessibility and SEO Happily Co-Exist</h2>
          <p class="talkDesc">Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and website accessibility are not the same thing. There are different rules to follow, different audiences to target, and different ways to test the effectiveness of each. Optimizing your website for search engine bots does not mean it will be automagically accessible to real people too. Some SEO practices may even hurt your website’s accessibility. However it is not all bad news, there are some areas where the two worlds overlap. If you have a limited budget and/or timeframe for a project, targeting these five areas may simultaneously boost both SEO and website accessibility.</p>

          <p class="talkDesc">The CSS Grid Layout specification is one of the most exciting additions to CSS in the last few years. It comes with a variety of new properties, units, functions and related specs, but it also entails new dangers. In this talk Manuel gives a quick introduction to CSS Grid Layout and confronts said dangers by explaining what’s problematic about them and providing alternative solutions. You’ll learn what you need to watch out for when working with grids, why source order matters, how to work with legacy browsers and about the ups and downs of recent display values.</p>

          <p class="talkDesc">You’ve checked your colour contrast, been diligent about ALT tags, and doubled up font size, yet your product still isn’t accessible? When AODA guidelines fall short in getting your design up to speed, it’s time to start bringing real users with disabilities into your research pool, (actually, it might be well past that time - get on it!). This talk will equip researchers of all levels with the points they need to advocate for inclusive research practices within their organizations. More importantly, Mel will be covering three key principles for designing and facilitating successful user research activities alongside users with disabilities.</p>

In this talk, she’ll share some recurring usability themes from five years of working with seniors on email, desktop basics, social media, and popular mobile apps. Using these experiences as our guide, we’ll explore the universal design principles to apply and the anti-patterns to avoid to make your technology more “intuitive” for all.</p>

          <h2 class="talkName">Designing and Developing for the Neurodivergent Mind</h2>
          <p class="talkDesc">During this talk Shell Little will break down some of the stigma behind what it means to be Neurodivergent and the struggles experienced in an ableist society from the perspective of an Accessibility Specialist with ADHD. Attendees will learn about the shortcomings of WCAG for people with Attention Related and other types of Cognitive Disabilities, with a focus in mobile spaces. What Assistive Technology means to someone who is Neurodivergent will be discussed in order to understand how easy it is to block someone from using the tools they need to complete daily tasks. The talk will wrap up by discussing some of the major concerns Neurodivergent people have when it comes to technology and how to address them to remove barriers and increase usability. Until we understand the experiences of people with Cognitive Disabilities we will continue to make design and development decisions that create inaccessible digital spaces. It's time we think more about Neurodivergent users when we are designing experiences. Attendees can expect to leave this talk with a richer understanding and empathy for Cognitive Disabilities and the information needed to go out and apply it.</p>

          <h2 class="talkName">SC 1.3.5 - More than just autocomplete</h2>
          <p class="talkDesc">Published in May 2018, WCAG 2.1 was the first major update to the WCAG standard in over 10 years. The update added a number of new Success Criteria primarily aimed at closing significant known gaps to address the needs of users with low vision, to address new concerns brought about by touch input and mobile screens, and to start to address the needs of people with cognitive disabilities. One such new Success Criteria is SC 1.3.5 – Purpose of Controls. But why? What are the real benefits of this requirement? How do I as a developer successfully meet that requirement? How and why did this Success Criteria come to be? As we started to ask people about their understanding of this requirement, there seemed to be some confusion. And confusion is never good. In this presentation, John will do a deep-dive on SC 1.3.5: the history, the process, the blood-sweat-and-tears involved in getting a new Success Criteria through the WCAG process. We’ll look at the immediate benefit of this new Success Criteria today, as well as gain insight to the much larger goal that this Success Criteria kicks off. We’ll examine techniques (both current and future), and we’ll end up with a developer’s challenge – and there will be a prize!</p>

          <h2 class="talkName">A Primer on the Designer's a11y Responsibility</h2>
          <p class="talkDesc">Accessibility specialists have long been thorns in the development team's side since accessibility testing traditionally only took place as an afterthought near the end of the product life cycle. However, accessibility thinking really starts long before a single line of code is ever written. This talk will provide examples of how designers can incorporate inclusive thinking in their existing toolkit (e.g. user personas, annotating wireframes) and start designing usable experiences that reduce the impact on the development team's velocity.</p>

          <p class="talkDesc">Most of us factor in technology literacy and competence when we develop. We want things to be as intuitive and "user-friendly" as possible. But for those aging into disabilities, learning computers can be a process of re-learning with a daily changing brain. Sassy's talk will focus on assistive technology training practices, such as task-based training, step-by-step training, and how these training models intersect with websites you are building, or apps you are testing. WCAG 2.1 covers a lot, but gaps are emerging in how we design for those aging into disability, and how you develop, and how we train need to meet soon, or the silver tsunami will continue to face more access barriers to technology, on top of perception-based barriers like fear and lack of training that they already encounter.</p>
