<p>Toronto is Canada’s largest city and a world leader in business, finance, technology, entertainment and culture. Its large population of immigrants from all over the globe has also make Toronto one of the most multicultural cities in the world.</p>

<h2>Arriving in Toronto</h2>
<p>Toronto has two airports: the downtown <a href="https://www.billybishopairport.com/" rel="external nofollow">Billy Bishop Airport (YTZ)</a> and <a href="https://www.torontopearson.com/" rel="external nofollow">Pearson International (YYZ)</a>.</p>
<p>Billy Bishop is closer to the venue but offers limited flight options. Billy Bishop also provides free shuttle service to the downtown core near the venue. Travelling to Pearson International Airport, you can take a light rail train (<a href="https://www.upexpress.com/en" rel="external nofollow">Union Pearson Express</a>) to the downtown core near the venue. Costs will vary depending on your travel arrangements.</p>
