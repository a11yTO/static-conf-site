<p>One thing we all have in common is that we were all new to accessibility at one time. With any new endeavor, mistakes are inevitable. Instead of letting those embarrassing moments from our past keep us awake at night, let’s celebrate and learn from them with a little bit of humour. </p>
<p><img class="convince" src="/assets/a11yOoopsLogo.png" alt="Graffiti style a11yOops logo"></p>
<p>We can’t think of a better way to kick off a week of learning how to make the web better than with an evening of laughing about all of the ways we made it worse.  Join <strong>#a11yTO</strong> on Wednesday, October 2, 2024, from 6pm to 9pm, at League Offices, for the first a11yOops event.</p>
<h2>What is a11yOops?</h2>
<p>It’s an evening of 3 to 5 minute anecdotes shared by the audience about all of the ways they have messed up when they started in accessibility. Maybe it was bad advice they gave, an assumption they made, or any other bits of our early careers that we swore we’d never speak of again. </p>
<p>To be perfectly clear, this <strong>IS NOT</strong> an event where we pick on the works of others, or any companies or products. The intent of the evening is to share embarrassing moments from our own pasts so that folks new to the industry understand that it’s OK to make mistakes - that’s how we grow.</p>
