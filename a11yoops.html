<p>Anyone who has been in any field for a while knows that you often learn more from your mistakes than you do from being a natural at something. It could have something to do with lessons learned from our mistakes, or perhaps the lasting embarrassment seared into our brains. Who knows?</p>
<p>What we do know is that last year we got together and shared some of those embarrassing stories and had a blast. So much so that we are doing it again--that’s right, A11yOops is back for a second year on Thursday, October 16th at League Offices.</p>
<p>If you don’t know, this event is all about sharing our past mistakes while working in accessibility in a safe and non-judgmental space. Note the emphasis on “our” mistakes. We are here to share personal missteps, not to comment on the mistakes of others, or to drag any companies or products.</p>
<p>Want an example? Last month, we put out a newsletter announcing how excited we were about the conference venue, but unfortunately, we forgot to include the venue name. See? Even we mess up sometimes. BTW… It’s the Barbara Frum Atrium at CBC Studios.  </p>
<p>A11yOops is a separately ticketed event and is open to everyone, not just <strong>#a11yTO Conf</strong> attendees. Your admission to the event includes refreshments (including alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages) and a whole lot of laughs.</p>
