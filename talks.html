  <h2 class="talk-name">Disability and inclusion in Latin America: How digital accessibility can remove barriers from job searching websites</h2>
  <div class="talk-desc">
    <p>This project focuses on detecting the issues that block disabled users’ interactions with websites and how that affects their job search. Using WCAG 2.1 guidelines as support, and measuring recurrent issues presented, we will propose a replicable and scalable methodology of testing, and provide simple solutions to accessibility design related issues that are creating barriers for disabled people. It’s everyone’s responsibility to allow work to be accessed in a free and equitable way, like the Human Rights declaration proposes, towards inclusion.</p>

      <p>I am an Accessibility specialist, focused on inserting accessibility into the product development process. Also working on the WAS (Web Accessibility Specialist) certification translation as a subject matter expert. I am interested to generate contributions that imply a social impact in the community, both from a scientific approach, using methodologies to obtain concrete results, and generating strategies oriented to digital accessibility. My ultimate goal is to be able to provide tools for the empowerment of people with disabilities in today's world.</p>

  <h2 class="talk-name">Setting accessibility specialists up for success in organizations</h2>
  <div class="talk-desc">
    <p>Accessibility specialists, as well as designers, developers, and testers who want to center accessibility in their work, can often feel overwhelmed and unsupported. We're frequently asked to be responsible for organization-wide change management, project and program management, evangelism, road maps, training, testing, and mentorship. We often risk burnout and failure in systems that are not actually designed to help us succeed. In this talk, I'll explore some of the ways that we're let down, and ways we can center caring for ourselves to keep doing the work.</p>

    <div class="speaker-bio">
      <p>I'm an accessibility specialist who's been in the field for about 10 years, after a short career as a librarian. My experience is primarily with accessibility consulting agencies and large tech organizations. I'm most interested in solving problems to make accessibility work more sustainable for everyone involved, and with a focus on usability over compliance. When I'm not doing accessibility work, I'm gardening, writing, playing or running Dungeons & Dragons games, petting a cat, or playing video games. I live in Seattle, WA, which I've called home since 2010. I identify as a disabled person and have a history with chronic illness.</p>
