          <p class="talkDesc">What can a six year old boy and his stuffed tiger tell us about accessibility? Not a great deal as it turns out, but in their own inimitable style, they can provoke us into thinking about accessibility in new and interesting ways.</p>

          <p class="talkDesc">"Just put it in the Definition of Done", the Scrum master said as he walked out of the room, convinced of Agile's inherent benefits for collaboration, quality, and user-centrism and even further convinced that accessibility was "a given". We all agreed and cheered to ourselves that the SM was on our side. Reality, however, was a little different. This talk will focus on the trips and missteps along the way to adding accessibility in an agile environment.</p>

I have over a decade experience in doing IT consulting for the biggest companies in the world and biggest agencies in the US Government. Widely regarded as a pragmatic solution-finder, my work is cited in nearly a dozen books and used on curricula in Human-Computer Interaction across the globe.

          <h2>Rethinking web accessibility on Windows</h2>
          <p class="talkDesc">For more than 15 years, screen readers on Windows have consumed web sites in much the same manner: Consuming them in one go and providing their own representation of the web page in a so-called virtual document. As web applications have become more pwide-spread, it has become apparent that this way of consuming web content might no longer be timely. This talk aims to take a look at the status quo and ask some provocative questions on how this paradigm might, or must, change in the future for us to stay competitive and up to date in the more dynamic web application world.</p>
