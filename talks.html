  <h2 class="talk-name">How Does the Awareness of Assistive Technology Impact Students with Disabilities' Success at the College Level?</h2>
  <div class="talk-desc">
    <p>This research topic proposal was developed to investigate the impact of assistive technology in the students with disabilitiesâ€™ success within the context of college academia.</p>
    <p>The principal argument of this writing suggests that the lack of awareness of assistive technology by professors creates barriers that violate the rights of the individual with a disability under U.S. law. Several theories were explored that were relevant to learning and human development. </p>
