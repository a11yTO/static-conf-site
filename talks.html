  <h2 class="talk-name">The Double-Edged Sword of A11y: How Both Academia and Industry Get Accessibility Wrong</h2>
  <div class="talk-desc">
    <p>Academic institutions and private companies are both major contributors to our technology landscape, with a primarily theoretical and future-looking focus in academia and consumer product focus in industry. </p>
    <p>However, what is often not scrutinized is how accessibility (a11y) and disability are viewed by members within each institution, particularly non-disabled members. </p>
    <p>These viewpoints have a significant impact on the outcomes of inclusion. For example, many academic research papers focus on projects that are “for” disabled people, many consumer products in industry are inaccessible and create barriers, and rarely do either groups properly acknowledge the existence, autonomy, and inventiveness of disabled people leading to outcomes like “disability dongles”. </p>
    <p>This presentation will reflect on the various forms of ableism currently prevalent in both academia and industry in hopes of spurring more mindfulness of true inclusion.</p>

<section id="These-still-arent-the-SCs-youre-looking-for" class="talk">
  <h2 class="talk-name">These (still) aren't the SCs you're looking for...</h2>
  <div class="talk-desc">
    <p>WCAG is supposed to give us a reasonably objective way of saying whether or not the sites we are building/auditing are "accessible" (to a particular baseline). However, they are only as useful as our understanding and interpretation of the guidelines' normative text. And, of course, it is not perfect - with some omissions, handwaving, and straight-up loopholes. So where does this leave developers and auditors? </p>
    <p>In this talk - a reprise of a previous talk, now updated to cover new SCs from WCAG 2.2, Patrick may not have all the answers, but he'll have a good rant around the subject anyway...</p>

<section id="Redesigning-for-Cognitive-Ease" class="talk">
  <h2 class="talk-name">Redesigning for Cognitive Ease</h2>
  <div class="talk-desc">
    <p>After all the WCAG standards are met, how accessible is your site for users with cognitive disabilities? </p>
    <p>How can you tell? What does that mean? Where would you even start?</p>
    <p>I’d been making websites for over 20 years, and I didn’t understand what it was like to use the web with a cognitive disability until I developed one. After treatment to remove a slow-growing brain tumor, I had a hard time using most websites, including the ones I built! This real-world experience gave me a newfound perspective on accessibility, and I learned that there’s no better way to understand a user’s experience than living it. It also motivated me to learn new techniques that provide more accessible experiences for users with cognitive impairments and redesign parts of my sites with a focus on cognitive ease.</p>

In this talk I’ll explain how to clearly communicate your company’s stance on accessibility and avoid dead fish. I’ll also discuss how to structure your design system so accessibility guidance is easy to find and use.</p>
