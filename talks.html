  <h2 class="talk-name">Building Equitable and Inclusive Studios with Disabled Employees</h2>
  <div class="talk-desc">
    <p>After weeks spent scouring games and TV shows, I've found that the BBC guidelines' recommendation to "caption accents sparingly" actually fail d/Deaf and hard of hearing viewers, robbing them of the immersion in time and place that hearing viewers are given. Conversely, I will discuss how in my role at Epic Games, I caption for meaning (not verbatim) so all educational content is easy to parse. I will propose a new set of guidelines for both captioning purposes.</p>
