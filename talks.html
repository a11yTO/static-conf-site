  <h2 id="Behind-the-Insights" class="talk-title">Behind the Insights: How we keep missing disability in UX Research and what to do about it</h2>
  <div class="talk-desc">
    <p>As accessibility efforts mature within a team, someone eventually asks, “Can we include disabled people in our research?” The answer should be an easy yes — but in practice, it often doesn’t happen.</p>
    <p>This talk will explore the everyday barriers that prevent researchers from including disabled participants, from recruitment hurdles to inaccessible tools. But it will also go deeper to confront the ableist work practices that keep disabled people out of research roles altogether. We’ll get honest about how well-meaning teams contribute to a cycle of exclusion, even when inclusion is the stated goal.</p>

  <h2 id="Users-know-best" class="talk-title">Users know best: Embracing user styles for resilient designs</h2>
  <div class="talk-desc">
    <p>Users can choose from various ways to view your content, including fonts, text size, dark mode, reader mode, custom stylesheets, and more. By leaning into these user customizations instead of resisting them, we can design in a more resilient way that meets users where they are.</p>
    <p>We'll explore some common ways users customize their devices and examine techniques for anticipating and embracing those changes. Some specific examples will include Windows High Contrast Mode (aka forced-colors in CSS), changing the device font size, and user stylesheets.</p>

  <h2 id="The-Illusion-of-the-Rational-User" class="talk-title">The Illusion of the Rational User - Misbehavior, Distraction, Mistakes and Accessibility Testing for Real Life</h2>
  <div class="talk-desc">
    <p>We often assume that users behave rationally, believing they read instructions, follow a linear path, and complete tasks without error. But real interactions are far messier. People misclick, get distracted, skip instructions, or abandon tasks. For users with cognitive disabilities, ADHD, trauma histories, or anxiety, these behaviours are not edge cases. They are daily realities.</p>
    <p>Ina will demonstrate how accessibility testing can address these challenges through practical strategies based on cognitive accessibility principles, behavioural science, trauma-informed design, and emotional accessibility, making systems more forgiving, predictable, and inclusive.</p>

  <h2 id="Accessiologically" class="talk-title">Accessiologically: Humanizing Accessibility Compliance Through Experiential Examples</h2>
  <div class="talk-desc">
    <p>This talk offers a poetic yet practical perspective on digital accessibility. Through the original piece “Accessiologically,” Albert will guide the audience through the emotional, cognitive, and navigational barriers people face when digital products aren’t accessible. The poem’s structure reflects the layered nature of real-life testing: reading and understanding, scanning and navigating, interacting and reflecting.</p>
    <p>This session provides space for the human impact—the confusion, frustration, or relief users experience, beyond compliance, by integrating storytelling, experiential testing techniques, and critical reflection. </p>

  <h2 id="It-is-designed-to-break-your-heart" class="talk-title">It is designed to break your heart: Cultivating a harm reduction mindset as an accessibility practitioner</h2>
  <div class="talk-desc">
    <p>Working in digital accessibility requires so much. From design, to code, to theory, to practice. There’s also minding arcane, technical details, all the way up to the holistic big picture. Then factor in concerns like history, politics, law, and armchair psychology.</p>
    <p>For many of us, it is also deeply personal work, felt far deeper than the day-to-day requirements of a regular job. The constant demand for perfection, coupled with the asymmetry of power that accessibility work compels, is a recipe for harm if boundaries and protections are not established.</p>
    <p>This talk references the practice of harm reduction as a methodology to help you sustain your best efforts and avoid burnout.</p>

  <h2 id="Your-AI-is-Copying-Bad-Code" class="talk-title">Your AI is Copying Bad Code: How to Prompt AI-assisted Coding Tools for Accessible Outcomes</h2>
  <div class="talk-desc">
    <p>AI coding tools like GitHub Copilot, Cursor, and Claude Code are revolutionizing development by letting anyone build interfaces with simple prompts. But here's the problem: they're trained on decades of inaccessible code, perpetuating the same barriers we're fighting to eliminate. When you ask these tools to generate a web application, they can generate beautiful, but frequently inaccessible interfaces.</p>
    <p>This talk reveals how to become an "accessibility prompt engineer"—teaching developers specific techniques to guide AI tools toward WCAG-compliant outputs. Through live demonstrations and real-world examples, you'll learn proven prompting strategies that consistently produce semantic HTML, proper ARIA implementation, and inclusive interaction patterns. We'll explore how to validate AI-generated code for accessibility compliance and build team prompt libraries that make inclusive development the default, not an afterthought.</p>

  <h2 id="Trauma-Informed-Design-Research" class="talk-title">Trauma-Informed Design Research: Creating Safety in User Engagements on Sensitive Topics</h2>
  <div class="talk-desc">
    <p>Design is more than what users see: beyond fonts, colours, and legibility. It’s also about how we engage with people throughout the process. As designers and researchers, we gather stories and insights to center real experiences in the systems we build. But whether you work in healthcare, justice, housing, or accessibility fields, many of the people we interview and co-design with carry a history of adversity, marginalization, or trauma.</p>
    <p>What if the way we conduct research unintentionally harms the very people we aim to support? How do we create emotional and psychological safety during interviews, testing, and co-design sessions?</p>
    <p>This talk is especially relevant to Service Designers, UX Researchers, Civic Innovators, and Accessibility professionals working in complex or equity-driven spaces. You’ll leave with strategies to make your design work relationally safe and ethically grounded.</p>
