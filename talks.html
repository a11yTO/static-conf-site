                <p class="speaker-bio">Cherry Thompson is an accessibility consultant with a professional background in photography, film and visual art. After a 12 year career in these fields, disability led them to shift focus and adapt to a new career. They bring their experience in design, production and exploring marginalized identities with visual storytelling to the games industry. Cherry's disabilities have allowed them to specialize in accessibility in games with a particular focus on addressing complex motor and cognitive barriers. They've consulted on projects of various sizes from small indie developments to larger studios such as Xbox (Adaptive Controller), Guerrilla (Horizon Zero Dawn IP), The Coalition (Gears of War IP) and more. Their consulting experience includes education, work-shopping, design consultation, sensitivity reviews, accessibility audits and play testing. In addition, Cherry has delivered educational presentations in various studios and at GDC, Microsoft Bootcamp, EA and their favorite, the Games Accessibility Conference. They have a passion for making games inclusive for everyone regardless of their background or disabilities. Outside of games Cherry is a bird, nature and cake enthusiast and has a one eyed cat named Odin.</p>

            <h2 class="talk-name">Garbage Pail Components</h2>
            <p class="talk-desc">Oh, the horror! Hot garbage has taken over the web. Carousel Carol, Type-Ahead Tommy, Shallow Dom, Trappin' Tam...the gang's all here. We'll turn the "bad accessibility" dial up to 11 in order to feel the pain that users with disabilities experience on a regular basis. Some of the patterns in this talk will be directly inspired from real life instances–because we can't even make this stuff up. By facing our miserable fears and burning everything to the ground, we'll be reborn and better equipped to create truly successful user interfaces.</p>

            <h2 class="talk-name">Systems of Systems</h2>
            <p class="talk-desc">Design systems create an umbrella to to define the future of our design work. But design systems are not the biggest umbrella, so to speak—they exist under broader social, political, and infrastructural systems that affect the parameters, limitations, and variables of our system. Investigating design systems across many verticals, we'll look to see how design systems are impacted by the systems they live within. And beyond the verticals, we'll look to see how broader systems of power and oppression influence the design systems, and ultimately, the users who use the products defined by them. We'll look to see how to assess where our design systems live in broader ecosystems, the challenges inherent, and how to lean into the good, and resist the bad, to ensure we're serving all humans in an equitable and ethical way, maintaining safety and trust.</p>

            <h2 class="talk-name">fAuLT TEXT: The Modern Challenge Of Working With ALT TEXT</h2>
            <p class="talk-desc">"Billions of pictures are uploaded daily to sites and social networks. They are the life and blood of the web, and are the most prevalent resources on a page. However, in a study on accessibility, 70% of sites had missing or inaccurate alternative text. This all too important detail has sadly been left off the required checklist, degrading the user experience for many. In light, solutions around automation of this task have come into play, with much of it revolving around artificial intelligence, machine learning and computer vision. In fact, Google is currently running a Chrome experiment in where users can opt in to automated image description. However, that has also come with its own challenges.</p>
            <p>fAuLT TEXT: The Modern Challenge Of Working With ALT TEXT is a talk about alternative text, the importance of providing this information, the hurdles that have come in its processing, and though rooted in a good place - how automation isn't a true answer.</p>

Additionally, you can find him speaking at conferences, and touching base w/ the community - all with a radiant smile. Otherwise, he’s focusing on running the fastest 5k possible (surprise surprise).</p>

What you are doing is undertaking a task-oriented walkthrough. In this presentation, we will guide you through the steps to conduct task-oriented walkthroughs by adopting personas with different access needs and trying to complete key tasks as if you were the user. We’ll show you how this technique is equally useful at the design stage to help avoid potential issues before usability testing is possible, as well as to understand the experience in existing products. </p>

            <h2 class="talk-name">Civil Rights or Shakedowns: Ethics of the Digital Accessibility Legal Space</h2>
            <p class="talk-desc">The United States has seen an avalanche of web access lawsuits in the past three years.  What can Canada learn from the US legal landscape as it begins to implement the Accessible Canada Act? Some lawsuits advance accessibility, while others turn accessibility's potential for innovation into a narrow compliance issue or worse. Non-lawyers in the accessibility space can put the law in their pocket to motivate teams and gain executive buy-in. Distinguishing  between shakedown lawsuits and legal actions that protect the civil rights of disabled people is key.</p>

                <p>I'm a disability rights lawyer who has worked in the accessibility space since the mid-1990s.  I have worked with blind people and their organizations to advance digital accessibility with some of the largest companies in the United States.  My book about this work is called Structured Negotiation, A Winning Alternative to Lawsuits.  It tells the story of how blind people and their lawyers have used civil rights laws and collaboration to advance accessibility through relationship building and problem-solving instead of with conflict and expense.  I do a lot of speaking and training about digital accessibility and about how the law can help advance the civil rights of people with disabilities to participate in the digital world.  More on my website, including articles, media, and awards.</p>

Web accessibility professionals put repeated effort toward fighting accessibility barriers, and often feel like their work is never done.

            <p class="talk-desc">Adding "Must be WCAG 2.0 AA compliant" into RFPs doesn't produce accessible sites, so what does? How can we make sure that the procurement process helps select for those vendors who can build sites that follow best practices?

                <p>One of Mike Gifford’s goals, through his company OpenConcept Consulting Inc., is to fix the accessibility problems at the source using the Drupal open source content management system. By taking this approach over a million web sites are enabled to become more accessible. Mike is a Drupal Core Accessibility Maintainer and has been spearheading improvements in the Drupal community since 2009. Mike founded A11yYOW back in 2011 and has been active in the accessibility unconference/camp movement since then. Beyond working with Drupal, Mike is increasingly looking at the systems which perpetuate barriers in our society. Mike is an advocate of bringing accessibility into open source projects so that everyone can benefit.</p>
