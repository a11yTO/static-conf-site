  <h2 class="talk-name">The Double-Edged Sword of A11y: How Both Academia and Industry Get Accessibility Wrong</h2>
  <div class="talk-desc">
    <p>Academic institutions and private companies are both major contributors to our technology landscape, with a primarily theoretical and future-looking focus in academia and consumer product focus in industry. </p>
    <p>However, what is often not scrutinized is how accessibility (a11y) and disability are viewed by members within each institution, particularly non-disabled members. </p>
    <p>These viewpoints have a significant impact on the outcomes of inclusion. For example, many academic research papers focus on projects that are “for” disabled people, many consumer products in industry are inaccessible and create barriers, and rarely do either groups properly acknowledge the existence, autonomy, and inventiveness of disabled people leading to outcomes like “disability dongles”. </p>
    <p>This presentation will reflect on the various forms of ableism currently prevalent in both academia and industry in hopes of spurring more mindfulness of true inclusion.</p>
