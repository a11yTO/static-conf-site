            <h2 class="talk-name">The Quest for Peace as a Disabled Games Accessibility Specialist</h2>
            <p class="talk-desc">Four years doesn’t sound like a long time but it sure feels like it when your quest list is ever evolving and the paths are rarely peaceful. Cherry will be sharing their road to UX and Systems Design in games, born from a brush with death and a stubbornness to endure pain.</p>
            <p>Games are a unique medium with heavy interaction, incredible cultural significance, and a huge impact on disabled players for everything from quality of life to pain management. Accessibility has come on leaps and bounds but it’s still at a point where it’s seen as an add-on or ‘special’ rather than a core design principle.</p>
            <p>Being the specialist is about being The Noisy Thorn. What do you do when you always have to start from square one; breaking down social stigmas before you can get started on the fun technical stuff? How do you deal with the pressures of teaching so many about disability culture? What if the industry isn’t accessible to you? How do you tackle marginalization while also experiencing it?</p>
            <p>Cherry can’t promise to have the answers, is an existentialist, and often feels like they’re drowning, but they are also uncharacteristically optimistic and has big hopes for the future of games as the industry matures.</p>

                <p class="speaker-bio">Cherry Thompson is a games accessibility specialist/developer with a keen focus in systems design and user experience. They’ve worked on projects of various sizes from small indies like Gambrinous (Cardpocalypse), GlitchMN (HyperDot) to AAA such as Guerrilla Games (Horizon Zero Dawn), Media Molecule (Dreams), Crystal Dynamics (Marvel’s Avengers), Ubisoft and more.</p>
                <p>Cherry is also autistic, so to their complete surprise, they’ve been a successful public speaker at conferences like GDC, Full Indie, PAX, and internal to many studios. This was all thanks to a gentle push from their favourite Games Accessibility Conf. They have a passion for making both games and the industry inclusive of everyone. Their hobbies consist of cake eating, bird watching and adventuring with their one eyed cat, Odin.</p>

        <section id="Garbage-Pail-Components" class="talk">
            <h2 class="talk-name">Garbage Pail Components</h2>
            <p class="talk-desc">Oh, the horror! Hot garbage has taken over the web. Carousel Carol, Type-Ahead Tommy, Shallow Dom, Trappin' Tam...the gang's all here. We'll turn the "bad accessibility" dial up to 11 in order to feel the pain that users with disabilities experience on a regular basis. Some of the patterns in this talk will be directly inspired from real life instances–because we can't even make this stuff up. By facing our miserable fears and burning everything to the ground, we'll be reborn and better equipped to create truly successful user interfaces.</p>

            <h2 class="talk-name">Systems of Systems</h2>
            <p class="talk-desc">Design systems create an umbrella to to define the future of our design work. But design systems are not the biggest umbrella, so to speak—they exist under broader social, political, and infrastructural systems that affect the parameters, limitations, and variables of our system. Investigating design systems across many verticals, we'll look to see how design systems are impacted by the systems they live within. And beyond the verticals, we'll look to see how broader systems of power and oppression influence the design systems, and ultimately, the users who use the products defined by them. We'll look to see how to assess where our design systems live in broader ecosystems, the challenges inherent, and how to lean into the good, and resist the bad, to ensure we're serving all humans in an equitable and ethical way, maintaining safety and trust.</p>

            <h2 class="talk-name">fAuLT TEXT: The Modern Challenge Of Working With ALT TEXT</h2>
            <p class="talk-desc">"Billions of pictures are uploaded daily to sites and social networks. They are the life and blood of the web, and are the most prevalent resources on a page. However, in a study on accessibility, 70% of sites had missing or inaccurate alternative text. This all too important detail has sadly been left off the required checklist, degrading the user experience for many. In light, solutions around automation of this task have come into play, with much of it revolving around artificial intelligence, machine learning and computer vision. In fact, Google is currently running a Chrome experiment in where users can opt in to automated image description. However, that has also come with its own challenges.</p>
            <p>fAuLT TEXT: The Modern Challenge Of Working With ALT TEXT is a talk about alternative text, the importance of providing this information, the hurdles that have come in its processing, and though rooted in a good place - how automation isn't a true answer.</p>

What you are doing is undertaking a task-oriented walkthrough. In this presentation, we will guide you through the steps to conduct task-oriented walkthroughs by adopting personas with different access needs and trying to complete key tasks as if you were the user. We’ll show you how this technique is equally useful at the design stage to help avoid potential issues before usability testing is possible, as well as to understand the experience in existing products. </p>

            <h2 class="talk-name">Civil Rights or Shakedowns: Ethics of the Digital Accessibility Legal Space</h2>
            <p class="talk-desc">The United States has seen an avalanche of web access lawsuits in the past three years.  What can Canada learn from the US legal landscape as it begins to implement the Accessible Canada Act? Some lawsuits advance accessibility, while others turn accessibility's potential for innovation into a narrow compliance issue or worse. Non-lawyers in the accessibility space can put the law in their pocket to motivate teams and gain executive buy-in. Distinguishing  between shakedown lawsuits and legal actions that protect the civil rights of disabled people is key.</p>

                <p>I'm a disability rights lawyer who has worked in the accessibility space since the mid-1990s.  I have worked with blind people and their organizations to advance digital accessibility with some of the largest companies in the United States.  My book about this work is called Structured Negotiation, A Winning Alternative to Lawsuits.  It tells the story of how blind people and their lawyers have used civil rights laws and collaboration to advance accessibility through relationship building and problem-solving instead of with conflict and expense.  I do a lot of speaking and training about digital accessibility and about how the law can help advance the civil rights of people with disabilities to participate in the digital world.  More on my website, including articles, media, and awards.</p>

Web accessibility professionals put repeated effort toward fighting accessibility barriers, and often feel like their work is never done.
