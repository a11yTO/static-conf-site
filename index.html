<h2>The Event</h2>

<p>We are pleased to announce that a11yTO Conf is returning to the Barbara Frum Atrium at CBC on October 22 & 23, 2026.</p>
<p>Mark those calendars, save the date, and get ready for two amazing days of learning and networking with fellow attendees from around the world.</p>
<p>This year, we are excited to take Conf back to what started it - a focus on technical talks with clear, actionable takeaways. No matter what your role is, we will have a talk for you.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for updates about speaking opportunities, tickets, and our evening events in the coming weeks. We’ll be opening up the call for presentations later this winter (date TBA), so start refining those ideas, and look out for announcements about the call.</p>
