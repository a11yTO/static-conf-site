<h2>The Event</h2>
<p><strong>#a11yTO Conf</strong> Returns!</p>
<p>Here it is, friends, the moment you’ve all been waiting for. <strong>#a11yTO Conf</strong> is <strong>BACK</strong>! Mark your calendars, pack your bags, and get ready to join us on October 16th and 17th in beautiful downtown Toronto, Canada.</p>
<p><a href="https://tickets.a11yto.com/e/31/a11yto-conf-2025">Tickets are on sale now</a>.</p>
<p>Last year we got together and shared some of those embarrassing stories and had a blast. So much so that we are doing it again--that’s right, A11yOops is back for a second year.</p>
<p><a href="/a11yoops">Join us on Thursday, October 16 at League Offices</a></p>
<p>Thank you, and we look forward to seeing you all in Toronto this October. </p>
<p>The <strong>#a11yTO</strong> Team</p>
