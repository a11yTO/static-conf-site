<h1>The Event</h1>
<p>Join us online from the safety of your home! We tried to hold out in hopes of running an in-person event this year, but we've decided to run our 2021 Conference as a virtual event.</p>
<p><a href="https://a11y.ca/e/3">Take advantage of our early-bird special</a> until September 6 and get on-demand access to the 2020 Conf and 2021 Camp recordings!</p>
<p>Our unique three-day online one-track conference offers a curated "playlist" of lectures, demos, and lightning talks. Our mix of presentations and learning styles provides a unique and immersive experience.</p>
