<h1>Thank You!</h1>
<p>For the first time, <strong>#a11yTO Conf</strong> was 100% virtual! From Wednesday, October 21st to Friday, October 23rd, 2020, we hosted three days of virtual accessibility training, through our unique three-day, online single-track conference of a curated "playlist" of lectures, demos, and lightning talks.</p>
<p>Thank you for another great year, see you again in 2021!</p>
