<p>Join us online from the safety of your home! We tried to hold out in hopes of running an in-person event this year, but we've decided to run our 2021 Conference as a virtual event.</p>
<p>Our unique three-day online one-track conference offers a curated "playlist" of lectures, demos, and lightning talks. Our mix of presentations and learning styles provides a unique and immersive experience.</p>
<p>Please note: <strong>#a11yTO</strong> Talks are shared from Toronto, Canada (UTC-4 hours)</p>
