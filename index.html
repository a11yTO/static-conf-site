<h2>The Event</h2>
<p><strong>#a11yTO Conf</strong> will run on October 17th and 18th. As we promised last year, this Conf will be a hybrid event allowing for either in-person and remote attendance. The call for presentations is open so start working on those talk ideas!</p>
<p>Our unique online single-track conference offers an immersive experience with curated presentations, demos, and lightning talks.</p>
